# cl-sak
The Cross-Lingual Safety Audit Kit (CL-SAK) is a Python CLI for assessing multilingual safety in LLMs. It runs policy, jailbreak, translation-exploit, and code-switching prompts, labels outcomes, and outputs a summary, CSV/JSONL metrics, and a language-and-category heatmap. It is provider-agnostic, reproducible, and defaults to redacted previews.
