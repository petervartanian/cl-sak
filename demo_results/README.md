# Demo Results

This folder contains a small, **redacted** sample run so reviewers can see outputs without running the tool.

Files:
- `EXEC_SUMMARY.md` — 1–2 page summary of the run
- `metrics.csv` — flat metrics by prompt
- `full_results.jsonl` — one JSON object per prompt (previews redacted by default)
- `heatmap.png` — safety rate by language × category
